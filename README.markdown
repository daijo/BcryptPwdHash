Bcrypt PwdHash
==============

Modified version of the Stanford PwdHash. The original PwdHash generates theft-resistant passwords but uses a weak hashing method. This is the same thing but using the stronger Bcrypt hashing. It requires you to keep a randomly generated salt to retrive your hashed password later.
